Locate the system header files <stdio.h>, <limits.h> and <float.h> on your
system and exlpore /usr/include directory.

On UNIX-based systems use the folloing commands to search for the above files:

whereis filename
locate filename

To explore the content of /usr/include directory use:

ls -lh /usr/include

you can pipe the outcome into the grep command to limit your search criteria.
For example, ls -lh /user /usr/include | grep -i "std"
