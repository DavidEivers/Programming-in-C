/*
 * 7. Prime numbers can also be generated by an algorithm known as the Sieve of
 * Eratosthenes. The algorithm for this procedure is presented here. Write a
 * program that implements this algorithm. Have the program find all prime
 * numbers up to n = 150. What can you say about this algorithm as compared to
 * the ones used in the text for calculating prime numbers?
 *
 *	Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm
 *	To Display All Prime Numbers Between 1 and n
 *	Step 1: Define an array of integers P. Set all elements Pi to 0,
 *			2 <= i <= n.
 *	Step 2: Set i to 2.
 *	Step 3: If i > n, the algorithm terminates.
 *	Step 4: If Pi is 0, then i is prime.
 *	Step 5: For all positive integer values of j, such that i x j â‰¤ n,
 *			set Pixj to 1.
