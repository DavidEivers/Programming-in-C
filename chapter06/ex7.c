/*
 * 7. Prime numbers can also be generated by an algorithm known as the Sieve of
 * Eratosthenes. The algorithm for this procedure is presented here. Write a
 * program that implements this algorithm. Have the program find all prime
 * numbers up to n = 150. What can you say about this algorithm as compared to
 * the ones used in the text for calculating prime numbers?
 *
 * Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm
 * To Display All Prime Numbers Between 1 and n
 * Step 1: Define an array of integers P. Set all elements Pi to 0, 2 <= i
 *         <= n.
 * Step 2: Set i to 2.
 * Step 3: If i > n, the algorithm terminates.
 * Step 4: If Pi is 0, then i is prime.
 * Step 5: For all positive integer values of j, such that i x j â‰¤ n, set Pixj
 *         to 1.
