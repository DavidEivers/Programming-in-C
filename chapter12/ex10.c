/* 
 * 10. Consider the definition of the printint macro from this chapter:
 *
 * 		#define printint(n)  printf ("%i\n", x ## n)
 *
 * Could the following be used to display the values of the 100 variables
 * x1â€“x100? Why or why not?
 *
 * 		for (i = 1; i < 100; ++i) 
 * 			printx (i);
 *
 * Answer: No. Because the preprocessor will perform a literal text
 * substitution on the value of n for i. Thus, printf(i) will be evaluated as
 * printf("%i\n", xi).
